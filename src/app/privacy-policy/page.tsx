              Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how
              we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information when you
              use our website and services. By using our website, you consent to
              the practices described in this policy.

            <h2>Information We Collect:</h2>
            <p>
              We do not collect any personal information from you. Our website
              is designed to work entirely client side, meaning that all
              processes and interactions with Spotify APIs occur directly on
              your device without involving our servers. We do not store or have
              access to any data related to your Spotify account, playlists, or
              music preferences.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Spotify API Access:</h2>
            <p>
              When you use our website, it will request access to your Spotify
              account through the Spotify API. This access is solely used to
              retrieve information about your public playlists and the music
              contained within them, in order to provide you with a personalized
              music experience. We do not store or retain any of this data, nor
              do we have access to your Spotify account beyond the immediate
              session.
            </p>
